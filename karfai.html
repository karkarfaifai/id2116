       <p> I'm currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, majoring in Industrial Design. As a tinkerer at a young age, I always found joy in playing with toys, tearing them apart to understand the construct and fixing them back together. This fascination over objects, mechanisms, materials, textures & colours brought me to design. But the design I pursue isn't in creating objects of beauty or gimmicks, it's a practice of the finding solutions. Solutions to address a problem for individuals and beyond.</p>
